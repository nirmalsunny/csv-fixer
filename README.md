# csv-fixer
Have you downloaded a csv file and when you open it in any spreadsheet application, the values are in wrong coloumns?

This PHP tool tries to fix the values in the wrong coloumns.

As of now, the program takes JSON (from any CSV to JSON convertor) and outputs JSON (to be converted to CSV or XLSX)
